## Overview of Complex Portal

The Complex Portal is a manually curated, encyclopaedic resource of macromolecular complexes from a number of key model organisms. 

Complexes are defined as an assembly of any two or more proteins and/or nucleic acids that are stable enough in vitro to be reconstituted and have been demonstrated to have a specific molecular function. They may also contain small molecules if they are essential, functional components.

In addition to the manually curated complexes, which adhere to this definition, the database provides extended coverage of the human complexome with high confidence assemblies of machine-learning predicted complexes.

All manually curated complexes are derived from physical molecular interaction evidences extracted and cross-referenced from the literature and cross-referenced to the Molecular Interaction Database [IntAct](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/) where available, or by curator inference from information on homologs in closely related species or by inference from scientific background. All manually curated complexes are tagged with [Evidence and Conclusion Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/eco) codes to indicate the type of evidence available for each entry.

**Special considerations:**

- Stoichiometry is only included when it has been directly determined experimentally.

- Kinetic data is not included but can be found in [IntAct](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/) if a related publication has been curated there. 

- Transient complexes such as enzyme-substrate assemblies or pre-assembly structures of large machineries are not curated. 

- Large, multi-complex machineries are reduced to their functional subcomplexes both for ease of annotation and also because the final assemblies are often dynamic, rather than a single instance of a functional unit existing at any moment of time. The subcomplexes of large assemblies are annotated with GO terms relating to the larger machineries, for example, all [spliceosome sub-complexes](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/complex/search?query=GO:0005681&page=1) are annotated with the GO term [GO:0005681 spliceosomal complex](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0005681) to facilitate searching.

- Homomultimers are only curated if it has been demonstrated experimentally that multimerization is required for its function or when there was a heterodimeric complex and at least one of the two components formed an orthologous homodimeric complex. This strategy was adopted because it is often difficult to prove experimentally that a protein must form a homomer to be functionally active, because some homomers donâ€™t become active until they are part of a bigger assembly. 

- Homomultimeric polymers and filaments are not curated.

- Judgment of what constitutes a stable complex is based on a consensus decision made by two curators.
